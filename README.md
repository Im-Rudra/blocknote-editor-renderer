# Blocknote.js Editor

## Overview

Blocknote.js Editor is a project aimed at developing a versatile block editor and renderer tailored for various applications, with a primary focus on enhancing user experience and search engine optimization (SEO). Utilizing cutting-edge technologies such as Next.js, TailwindCSS, Shadcn-ui, and Typescript, this project aims to provide a seamless editing experience coupled with robust rendering capabilities.

## Resolution

The Blocknote.js Editor and Renderer are integral components of my future project, fikr, a feature-rich blog website powered by Next.js@14. By leveraging the capabilities of Blocknote.js, I aim to enhance the user experience and bolster the SEO performance of fikr. The seamless integration of the editor and renderer ensures that content creation and presentation are optimized for maximum visibility and engagement, aligning perfectly with the goals of the fikr project. With this resolution in mind, I am committed to developing and refining the Blocknote.js components to meet the specific requirements of fikr and deliver a compelling blogging experience to its users.

## Features

- **Client-Side Editing:** The block editor component is designed for client-side usage, ensuring smooth interactions without the need for server rendering.
- **Customizable Output:** The editor generates JSON or JavaScript Objects as output, offering flexibility and ease of integration with different projects.
- **SEO-Friendly Rendering:** To address the critical SEO requirements of blog content, a custom renderer is being developed from scratch. This renderer ensures that the content is optimized for search engine visibility while maintaining the desired visual presentation.
- **Custom Blocks:** The project includes the creation of custom blocks tailored to specific needs, such as a video component for embedding videos within the editor and a custom paragraph block optimized for Arabic text with distinct styles and fonts.
- **Documentation-Centric Development:** Given the absence of video tutorials, the development process relies heavily on thorough documentation, ensuring that all schemas are maintained properly with TypeScript.

## Challenges

- **Renderer Development:** The primary challenge lies in creating a renderer from scratch to achieve SEO optimization, addressing the limitations of using the editor in readonly mode.
- **Custom Block Implementation:** Developing necessary custom blocks, such as the video component and Arabic paragraph block, requires meticulous attention to detail and careful schema maintenance.
- **Limited Resources:** With no video tutorials available, the development process relies on self-guided exploration and documentation review, emphasizing independent problem-solving skills.

## Project Status

- **Early Development:** The project is in its early stages, with ongoing refinement of file structure, theme configuration, and feature implementation.
- **Not Ready for Third-party Use:** While progress is being made, the project is not yet suitable for integration into third-party projects. Continuous updates and improvements are planned to enhance functionality and stability.
